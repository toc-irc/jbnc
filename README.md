# jbnc
## IRC Bouncer/IRC Gateway with no authentication required written in nodejs with support for separate client buffers for playback history, an always-on connection, and SSL in and out.

## This is the missing link for IRC.

### Purpose
Bouncers are hard to configure.  I felt that we needed an easier one in this world.  This requires nearly no configuration to connect!  Just set a password!
Join #jbnc on freenode to learn more!

There are many users and networks who are stably using it today!

### Features
- Always on connection to IRC
- No registration or account required
- Separate buffers for clients
- SSL
- SASL
- Works with any RFC 1459 Compatible Client
- Password can be changed in the config and a HUP will reload the passwords.
- ***Gateway Mode for IRC Servers and Networks (See Below)***

### Compatibility
Works on:
- Freenode
- Rizon
- DALnet
- OFTC
- EFnet
- Any RFC1459 Compliant Network/Server

### Setup / Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/realrasengan/jbnc
```
2. Edit config (there are different example.confs for different use cases)
```
cp example.conf jbnc.conf
<edit> jbnc.conf
```
Values:
```
mode: gateway|bouncer
bouncerPassword: leave blank for no password
serverPort: if gateway mode, else ignored
server: if gateway mode, else eignored
webircPassword: if its there, it will try webirc authentication
webircHashIp: true or false if you want to just hide their ip but provide a hash
webircProxy: true or false if you want to pass their real ip (only matters with stunnel)
ingresswebircPassword: a password for webirc clients to use when connecting to jbnc
bouncerIp: ip you want to bind to or leave null
bouncerPort: port for bnc (do "+6697" if you want SSL (wrap in "" and put +)),
bouncerAdmin: admin pass
bouncerShack: ping ack timeout
bouncerDefaultOpmode: auto op/voice/hop mode default (can be turned on per client using /jbnc)
bouncerTimeout: how long until after no clients connected will the user stay connected
bufferMaxSize: maximum # of bytes a client buffer can hold before its terminated or 0 for unlimited
MsgRedistribution: If enabled, will override the entire old system installed by default, and it will 
save the last 300 lines for both privmsgs and notices (except ctcp) and all separately by channel and by 
recipient. It records everything even if the client is logged into JBNC or not.
As soon as the client reconnects to JBNC, it will send all privmsgs / notices to the client. The 
IRC client should sort the msgids by checking if they are already received, if they are not received then 
the client updates the new messages. Once the client has updated all the new messages, then it should 
automatically send "/jbnc logclear" to remove the entire "privmsgnotice" array from the client 
connected to the JBNC.
```

3. Run
To use the default jbnc.conf in the same folder:
```
node bouncer.js &
```

To use another config file:
```
node bouncer.js somefile.conf &
```

#### Keep it running forever (no downtime)
To keep things running 24/7/365, there's a great app called [immortal](https://immortal.run/).

The immortaldir files are located in this repo (jbnc.yml).

Note: To use immortal on ubuntu, after following the steps on the page, please be sure to `systemctl enable immortaldir` as well as start.

### IRC Client
You just need to set your password in your jbnc config and then setup your IRC client:
Just put this in your password:
```
YourServerPassword||ConnectionPasswordGoesHere/ServerGoesHere
```
To save clientbuffers for your client
```
YourServerPassword||ConnectionPasswordGoesHere/ServerGoesHere/deviceid
```

Here is an example for a desktop and mobile setup with a password protected server (password: dragon) connecting to DALnet:
```
dragon||AJFiej2fn2345/irc.dal.net:6667/desktop
dragon||AJFiej2fn2345/irc.dal.net:6667/mobile
```

Here is an example for a desktop connecting to an irc server that is password protected and a bnc that is password protected:
```
dragon||AJFiej2fn2345/irc.dal.net:6667||somepassword/desktop
```

Optional: you can put the account at the end for SASL identification, ideal if the account is not the nick used:
```
dragon||AJFiej2fn2345/irc.dal.net:6667/mobile/ArMyN
```

Your connection password gets used to attempt SASL identification.

#### SSL Client
Use "+port" to do SSL.  For example:
```
dragon||Ajdfklsjfa/irc.dal.net:+6697/mobile
```

You can also use "=port" to do SSL with a self-signed cert.
```
dragon||Ajdfklsjfa/irc.dal.net:=6697/mobile
```

#### Whilst Connected
To get a list of commands:
```
/jbnc
```

## Gateway Mode
Enable gateway mode and run on the same box as your IRCd to instantly give all your users always on connectivity and seamless synchronization across all devices.

1. Edit the config file and use gateway mode instead of bouncer.

2. Run

### Gateway Mode Setup on Client Side

If you are running jbnc on the same machine as your irc server, let's say irc.example.com, then the only difference would be that your users would need to:

1. Use a different port (8888 default for plaintext and 9998 default for SSL)

2. Enter a password in their IRC client.  They make up the password and use it to identify to their connection.
```
SomePassword/buffername
```

An example buffername could be 'desktop' and on the mobile phone could be 'mobile.'
